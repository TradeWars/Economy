# Economy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TradeWars/Economy.svg?branch=master)

## Usage

TODO

How to interface with the service, either via Pawn or, if the service does not
directly communicate with the gamemode, whatever interface is provided.

## Deployment

TODO

Deployment should be done via Docker however there should also be instructions
on how to deploy a development instance for testing and integration with other
services.

## Tests

All Kotlin-specific tests reside inside of `src/test/kotlin`.
You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

If you need an example, take a look at `src/test/kotlin/org/tradewars/economy/ExampleTest.kt`.
